# Capstone Time - Getting Started

1. Your capstone is a single page app created with React.
1. **CRUD** is an easy way to get there.
1. Your capstone should include `relational` data.
1. Your capstone should demonstrate what you have learned during the first three months at NSS.
1. Share your initial idea with Brenda(or other senior instructor) and get 👍 `thumbs-up`
1. Flush out your proposal. Once complete, you will meet with an instruction team member to confirm your **realistic MVP**.

## Proposal
* Use Google Docs and provide a link to the instruction team. **Check out this >>** [Example.md](Example.md)
* Capstone Final Proposals DUE (EOD) - **October 15, 2020** (Sooner is better!)

* Project Overview
   * Consider:
      * What problem does your capstone address?
      * User Focused Goals
      * Your Goals
   * Wireframes
   * ERD
   * Describe any technology needed.
   * List any API's you will be using (an API is not necessary).
   * Define **MVP**
      * Outline the features and functionality
      * Create user stories
   * Start a project and tickets within Github repo.
   * Define Stretch Goals
      * List individual features

## Share all of the following with the instruction team
   1. Proposal
   1. Github Repo
   1. ERD, https://dbdiagram.io. Add to your project `README.md`.
   1. Wireframes - Plan/outline the components your project will need. Show the data relationship (props and state). You may hand draw or use a tool like https://moqups.com/, google docs or https://www.figma.com/. Add to your project `README.md`

### Cool and Helpful Stuff

* Need some JSON data to get started? Try: https://www.mockaroo.com/ or faker.
    * Make a fetch call, loop through and add to database to get a unique id.
* Looking for inspirational API's: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
* Got some cross origin relationship problems? Review this repo: https://github.com/BlaiseRoberts/proxy-server
